# Double Slide

## Overview
Double Slide is a multi-platform slide puzzle game. There are two sides of the puzzle, with tiles from each side colored blue and green. Like the original puzzle, you can slide tiles around using the empty square as a buffer. You can also flip a row or column to swap tiles between each side of the puzzle. Because of this, it is possible to have two empty squares on one side of the puzzle, and none on the other side. The goal is to place the numbers in order on each side of the puzzle, with only one color on each side.
